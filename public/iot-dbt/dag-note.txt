A note about Directed Acyclic Graph's:  When it comes to breaking down problems or building solutions in that space where business hits computers, you're likely to see DAG's.  Don't panic!  If a DAG isn't necessary you're problem isn't too complex; otherwise a graph ( "graph" in the mathy sense of the word, not the 📈 line graph sense) is likely the cleanest comprehensive comprehension of your problem.  If at first your graph looks like a mess, don't panic, iterate!  There is no right way of depicting a graph, but the act of iterating on your graph's structure and layout is an important datamodeling, managing dependencies, CI/CD, etc.  If time is involved your graph is probably directed and acyclic, even abstract concepts don't time travel.  dbt thinks about the stages of processing data in a DAG, and even presents the DAG to us visually in the auto generated docs.
