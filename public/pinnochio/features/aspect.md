Italian Aspect - Why Visualization Matters
Perfective vs Imperfective (the crucial distinction):

Perfective: "Pinocchio corse" (single completed action)
Imperfective: "Pinocchio correva" (ongoing/habitual action)
Scene-setting: "C'era una volta" (imperfective background)
Story events: "Geppetto prese l'ascia" (perfective foreground)

Additional Italian aspects:

Inchoative: "Si mise a correre" (started running)
Iterative: "Andava sempre" (always went - habitual)
Progressive: "Sta correndo" (is running right now)
