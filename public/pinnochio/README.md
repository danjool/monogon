## Technical Implementation

Vanilla JavaScript using ES6 modules and features:

- Semantic color mapping algorithm to assign consistent colors to words
- Tooltip system for displaying translations on mouseover

## Translation Methodology

The translation process follows a structured approach:

1. **Source Preservation**: Original Italian text maintains all punctuation, emphasis markers, and contractions
2. **Sentence Alignment**: Each Italian sentence directly corresponds to its English counterpart
3. **Cultural Context**: Important historical terms, customs, and references are explained in notes
4. **Dialogue Formatting**: Italian em-dash dialogue style is preserved while converting to English quotation conventions
5. **Historical Accuracy**: The English translation maintains a 19th century narrative tone appropriate to the period

## Dictionary System

The application uses a comprehensive Italian-English dictionary with:

- Base word forms (infinitives for verbs, singular for nouns)
- Common contractions with apostrophes preserved
- Conjugated verb forms for frequently used words
- Period-appropriate translations for archaic or regional terms
- Special handling for typographical elements like emphasis markers and complex punctuation

## App Structure

Flat file structure for convenient review and copy-pasting.
The only directories are `chapters` and `features` because directories are for hiding irrelevant content from eyes/models.
No dependencies, may the üê¶'s maintain.
