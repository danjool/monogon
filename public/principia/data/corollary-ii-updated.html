<p>This is how two forces <span class="AC">AC</span> and <span class="CD">CD</span> may be composed into one force <span class="AD">AD</span>, or one force decomposed into two forces. We can justify this with a simple physical experiment.</p>

<p>Imagine an elevated, round table seen from the side in the horizontal line <span class="KL">KL</span> with center at <span class="O">O</span>.</p>

<p>From the center <span class="O">O</span>, two unequal radii <span class="OM">OM</span> and <span class="ON">ON</span> extend outward. At the ends of these radii, weights <span class="A">A</span> and <span class="P">P</span> are suspended by cords <span class="MA">MA</span> and <span class="NP">NP</span>.</p>

<p>If we draw a perpendicular line <span class="KL">KOL</span> through the center, it intersects the cords at points <span class="K">K</span> and <span class="L">L</span>. Using the greater distance <span class="OL">OL</span>, we can draw a circle centered at <span class="O">O</span> that intersects cord <span class="MA">MA</span> at point <span class="D">D</span>.</p>

<p>When we draw line <span class="OD">OD</span> and construct lines <span class="AC">AC</span> (parallel to <span class="OD">OD</span>) and <span class="DC">DC</span> (perpendicular to <span class="OD">OD</span>), we can analyze the forces at work.</p>

<p>The total force of weight <span class="A">A</span> is represented by line <span class="AD">AD</span>. This force can be broken down into two components: <span class="AC">AC</span> and <span class="CD">CD</span>. The force <span class="AC">AC</span> pulls directly toward the center and doesn't cause rotation. The force <span class="CD">CD</span> pulls perpendicular to the radius and creates rotational force.</p>

<p>This perpendicular force <span class="CD">CD</span> has the same effect as if it were pulling at radius <span class="OL">OL</span>. The weights <span class="A">A</span> and <span class="P">P</span> will balance each other when they are inversely proportional to their distances from the center lineâ€”specifically, when weight <span class="A">A</span> is to weight <span class="P">P</span> as distance <span class="OL">OL</span> is to distance <span class="OK">OK</span>.</p>

<p>This principle explains how forces work in common mechanical devices like levers, balances, and wheels.</p>

<p>The same principle applies to inclined planes. If weight <span class="p">p</span> (equal to weight <span class="P">P</span>) is partly suspended by cord <span class="Np">Np</span> and partly supported by inclined plane <span class="pG">pG</span>, we can analyze the forces by drawing lines <span class="pH">pH</span> (vertical) and <span class="NH">NH</span> (perpendicular to the plane).</p>

<p>The downward force of weight <span class="p">p</span> (shown by line <span class="pH">pH</span>) can be resolved into forces <span class="pN">pN</span> and <span class="HN">HN</span>. These forces represent how the weight presses against perpendicular surfaces.</p>

<p>This same principle explains how wedges, screws, and other mechanical devices work by redirecting and transforming forces.</p>
