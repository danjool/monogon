## Errors during optimizing due to the insertion of invisible edges wrt to complicated nodes, eg stadiums; and perhaps directional indicators for subgraphs like 'direction LR', and maybe complex link defs like -->|text|-->.

## Support for all kinds of link types, arrow types, text insertion, incomplete
