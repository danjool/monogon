Render a robust simulation of an alternative cosmology.  

Possible features:
	extra physical dimensions
	alt relationships between space and time
	what if light accelerated?  decayed?  
	what if light shot out of your eyes?
	unexplained vertical cliff face?
	inside a dyson sphere?
	single flow of energy that everything is based off of?  multiple?
	sea analog - fog?
	if any cosmological idea is communicated to the player, it should be at least partially wrong (maybe even reality's valid explanation?)
	is there a life or death?
	can we just steal an old incorrect cosmology like Cavendish's or smush some together, what are they all?
	allow possibility of finding or making a telescope, microscope equivalent
	microscope could show alternative 'small cosmology', like a grid of activating cells
	telescope could show moving civilization on other side of dyson sphere
	an analog to telescope would just be a filtering a sun inside of a dyson sphere, so you could finally see the civ on the other side
	let 'gravity' be inside out, pushing instead of pulling (like dark ernegy but smaller)
	what if you could collect light to get a better image of something further away (like modern astronomy) but that technique was easier than telescopes
	


How are games already this?  Most games are simplified abstractions of reality, so it needs to be apparent to the player that the discrepancies between reality and simulation matter.

Games featuring alt cosmologies:
	Narrative: 
		Disco Elysium
		Planescape
	Mechanical: 
		A Slower Speed of Light
		Outer Wilds

Games where you get to creatively make stuff:
	Banjo Kazooie Nuts and Bolts
